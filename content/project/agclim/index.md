The Challenges of Global Agriculture in a Climate Change context (AgCLIM50) is funded by the Joint Research Centre (JRC) and implemented by the ENgAGE (Expert Network for Agro-Economic modelling) consortium represented by Wageningen Economic Research. Active members of the consortium include:
-	Wageningen Economic Research (co-ordinating), The Hague, Netherlands
-	International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), Laxenburg, Austria
-	Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (PBL), The Hague, Netherlands.
-	Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), Potsdam, Germany.
-	EuroCARE GmbH

AgCLIM50 research is a joint effort by members of the ENgAGE consortium with active support from JRC staff to design the study and interprete results. 

The first study analyses the global impacts of climate change on agricultural production, prices, trade, consumption and the potential for emission mitigation/adaptation strategies. For this purpose a set of 12 scenarios has been simulated that differed by:
-	SSP 1, 2, or 3
-	Climate shocks according to RCP2.6 or RCP 6.0.
-	Moderate mitigation aiming at the 2 degree target

Scenario results were compared between the models involved according to a reporting template.
