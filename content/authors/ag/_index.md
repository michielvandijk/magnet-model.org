Alessandro Gatto is a PhD candidate at LEI Wageningen UR and at the department of Agricultural Economics and Rural Policy (AEP) at Wageningen University and Research, Netherlands. 
He graduated and obtained is master degree in Development and Environmental economics from Wageningen University and Research. His major fields of research include quantitative analysis on the circular and on the biobased economy. He is currently working on his PhD project entitled "Alternative futures of a circular bio-based society: the economic consequences of adopting circularity at different spatial scales" supervised by Prof. Dr. Hans van Meijl and Dr. Marijke Kuiper and by the department of Animal Production Systems (APS) of Wageningen University and Research. The focus of his PhD revolves around the macroeconomic assessment of the transition to a circular and biobased economy. In this, he is elaborating solutions to assess the socioeconomic and environmental impacts of food and non-food losses and waste at different spatial scales, integrating the quantification and assessment of biophysical and nutritional flows within the MAGNET model. He aims to cast a light upon the current uncertainties around circularity and biobased sectors, estimating the magnitude of potential global failures in the transition to a sustainable food and non-food system.
