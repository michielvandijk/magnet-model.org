I am a senior researcher in the International Policy department at [Wageningen Economic Research](https://www.wur.nl/en/Research-Results/Research-Institutes/Economic-Research.htm) and I also hold a position of associate professor at the Faculty of Economics and Management at [Czech University of Life Sciences in Prague]
(https://www.pef.czu.cz/en/). 
Working at WECR enables me to combine various research interests. In the last 8 years, I have been involved in scientific projects that measured the impact of Research and Development on productivity and economic growth, both using a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) approach and econometric modelling. I also enjoy working on policy oriented research such as ex-ante or ex-post impact assessments of various EU policies, for instance the CAP, Fisheries & Aquaculture policy and most recently the Green Deal. Last but not least, I am interested in the broader interlinkages between food security, nutrition, health and the area of Sustainable Development Goals.
