Elisa Bardazzi is in completion of a PhD in Science and Management of Climate Change at Caâ€™ Foscari University, Italy. She developed a project on economic modelling of the impacts of climate change. In particular, She worked on modelling resource-oriented impacts (i.e. effects on water, food, energy), with focus on the themes of food security and water availability. 

As a background, she started as a development economist, with both the degrees achieved at the University of Florence, Italy. Always driven by her interests in themes such as welfare, inequality climate change and ecology, she hopes that her work will contribute to the creation of sustainable development for all and the achievement of the SDGs.
