He graduated and obtained Ph.D. and Habilitation in the area of economics (with specialization in econometrics) from the Warsaw School of Economics in Poland. His major fields of research include quantitative analysis and scenario development based on CGE and partial equilibrium models. He is currently working on building and applying economic models to answer policy questions related to environmental, international trade and food security issues. Over the past 30 years, he has been involved in economic modelling projects in Poland and the Netherlands. He was the head the Department of Economics Models, the Informatics Centre of the Central Planning Bureau of Poland and advisor to the President of the Agriculture Market Agency of Poland.
