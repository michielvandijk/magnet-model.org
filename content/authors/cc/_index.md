I am a researcher in the International Policy Division at [Wageningen Economic Research](https://www.wur.nl/en/Research-Results/Research-Institutes/Economic-Research.htm), part of [Wageningen University and Research](www.wur.nl). I am specialized in international trade and global value chains (GVCs). 

I am currently project leader for an international project (The Netherlands, Spain) to develop a new macro-micro linked framework to assess the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) for the European Commission. I am case study leader for Burkina Faso as part of a multi-country study for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the UK Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office. I am task leader responsible for the team (The Netherlands, Italy, France) integrating GVCs into an economic framework for the BATModel project, funded under the Horizon 2020 programme. In past projects, I was team leader for an assessment of the EU-Mercosur Agreement for the Dutch Government, and I was a team member on a project on long-term structural change for the European Commission. 

Before joining Wageningen, I worked at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the Center for Global Trade Analysis (GTAP), the World Bank, and the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC). I received my PhD and MSc from Purdue University and my BSc from American University. In my spare time, I enjoy hiking, swimming, painting, and reading.
