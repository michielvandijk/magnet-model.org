Saeed Moghayer is a senior researcher in agri-food sustainability at Wageningen
Economic Research. Saeed is a modelling expert with specific inclination towards
CGE modelling and the use of hybrid modelling approaches in quantifying the impacts
of agri-food and climate systems, and circular bio-economy actions. He holds a PhD in Mathematical Economics from
University of Amsterdam and a MSc in Dynamical Systems from Utrecht University.
Prior to WR, he worked as Sr. Research Scientist at TNO. Saeed has varied applied
research experience in major EU projects in resource efficiency and climate change
and with several agricultural and research organisations such as CCAFS (CGIAR
climate research program) in food system foresight.
