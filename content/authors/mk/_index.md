I am a senior researcher in the international policy department at [Wageningen Economic Research](https://www.wur.nl/en/Research-Results/Research-Institutes/Economic-Research.htm), part of [Wageningen University and Research](www.wur.nl). I am also a [GTAP](https://www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/default.asp) Research Fellow.
 
Quantitative research on sustainable food, nutrition security and inequality characterize my work. I currently focus on foresight analyses of autonomous trends and policies assessments on employment, nutrition and sustainability. A key tool for these integrated assessments is MAGNET, our in-house global general equilibrium (CGE) model of which I am one the main developers. Where relevant supplemented with models adding sub-national, non-economic or spatial detail.
