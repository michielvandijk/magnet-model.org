I am a junior researcher in the international policy department at Wageningen Economic Research. In my work I am focusing on food systems in low and middle income countries. I am especially interested in  projects focusing on the interlinkages and trade-offs between food security, poverty water management and climate change from an economic perspective. Next to working with MAGNET, I have experience in working with and combining various tools like GIS, econometrics and machine learning.
