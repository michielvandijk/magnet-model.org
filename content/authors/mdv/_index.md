I work as a researcher at Wageningen Economic Research (WEcR). Here, I am involved in projects related to foresight analysis of dietary transitions towards healthy and sustainable consumption. The main tool employed in these projects is MAGNET, a global Computable General Equilibrium model. I have also combined simulations performed with MAGNET with demand system estimations based on microdata to obtain detailed assessments at the household level. Furthermore, I have experience with field experiments, where I figured out the effectiveness of informational and stress reduction strategies to steer consumers towards healthier food choices.

Prior to joining WEcR, I had distinct roles in the public sector in Mexico, with a focus on monitoring an evaluation processes. I also undertook my own entrepreneurial endeavors with the same principle mentioned above: promoting healthier diets among people. I try to mirror such principle with my everyday life, for instance by putting sports as a priority; currently I am training for middle distance triathlons.
