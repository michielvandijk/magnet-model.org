I am a researcher in the international policy department at [Wageningen Economic Research](https://www.wur.nl/en/Research-Results/Research-Institutes/Economic-Research.htm), part of [Wageningen University and Research](https://www.wur.nl). 

I use a broad array of methods and tools to explore the economics of the environment and natural resources. I have worked for British civil services using cost benefit analysis and environmental valuation to study water resources management. During my PhD, I used game theory to study international fisheries agreements and bioeconomic modelling to analyse the optimal control of invasive species. I have 8 years of experience at Statistics Netherlands working on footprints analysis, circular economy, and national accounting for the Dutch North Sea. At Wageningen Economic Research I shall be continuing my work on input-output analysis and using MAGNET to analyse problems relating to the environment and biodiversity, while working to ensure the data behind the MAGNET of optimal quality.
