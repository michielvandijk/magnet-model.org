<p>Today at the parliament (COMAGRI), Commissioner Wojciechowski will present a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/news/study-finds-positive-impact-trade-agreements-agri-food-sectors">report</a> that analyzes the impact of 12 Free Trade Agreements on EU agri-food, based on MAGNET analysis.</p>
<p>According to the new study, the EU trade agenda is set to have an overall positive impact on the EU economy and the agri-food sector. Trade agreements are due to result in substantial increases in EU agri-food exports, with more limited increases in imports, creating a positive trade balance overall. The study also confirms that the EUâ€™s approach to grant a limited amount of lower duty imports (through tariff rate quotas) is the best approach in terms of protecting specific vulnerable agri-food sectors in the EU.</p>
