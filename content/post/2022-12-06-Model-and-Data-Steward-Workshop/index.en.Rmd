Jason Levin-Koopman from the MAGNET team presented the MAGNET model and operational philosophy to an audience of modelers and data stewards from Wageningen UR, during the [Wageningen model and data steward workshop](https://www.wur.nl/en/value-creation-cooperation/collaborating-with-wur-1/wdcc/show-wdcc/wageningen-model-datasteward-workshop.htm).

In addition to presenting the model itself, the presentation focused on the importance of teamwork in maintaining a flexible module based, continuously evolving model and how this way of operating can assist in collaborating across models and disciplines.
