I hold a PhD in economics and am currently a research economist in the International Policy department at Wageningen Economic Research. Within the modelling team, my research has been focused on working with MAGNET, a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of the world economy and using the MAGNET model to conduct research related to economic, environmental and policy issues. Recently, I have worked on a number of MAGNET-based studies including the HS level trade modelling, investment modelling, trade policy and climate change, and food and nutrition security analyses.
