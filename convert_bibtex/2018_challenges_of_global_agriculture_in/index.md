abstract: "The future impact of climate change on agricultural production is highly uncertain and is mostly analysed by prospective modelling exercises, with widely varying results due to differences in methods, scenarios and input data. Systematic model inter-comparison exercises have examined and narrowed these discrepancies by using alternative emission pathways. This paper extends that analysis by presenting a set of alternative scenarios by different climate and agro-economic models, harmonized with respect to basic model drivers, to assess the range of potential impacts of climate change on the agricultural sector by 2050. Moreover, it quantifies the economic consequences of stringent global emission mitigation efforts to stabilize global warming at 2C by the end of the century under different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). A key contribution is a vis-a-vis comparison of climate change impacts relative to the impact of mitigation measures. In addition, while most of the assessments until now considered climate change impacts and climate change mitigation policies separately, our scenario design allows to assess the impact of the residual climate change on the mitigation challenge. From a global perspective the impact of climate change on agricultural production by mid-century is negative but small. A larger negative effect on agricultural production, most pronounced for ruminant meat production, is observed when emission mitigation measures compliant with a 2C target are put in place. Our results indicate that a mitigation strategy that embeds residual climate change effects (RCP2.6) has a negative impact on global agricultural production relative to a no-mitigation strategy with stronger climate impacts (RCP6.0). However, this is partially debited to the limited impact of the climate change scenarios by 2050. The magnitude of price changes is different amongst models due to methodological differences. Sound analysis requires endogenous food demand with thoroughly calibrated substitution across individual commodities and feed, and endogenous technological change."
